Today I started the project. Began to slowly understand how the system
works. not much done on the programming end except for slowly
implementing some of the cpu instruction functions.

Found a couple helpful resources to help me along and a couple
existing projects to help me. Things are looking.... hopeful

TLDR: So like basically so far I've started researching the
architecture and stuff and begun implementing the CPU starting with the instructions

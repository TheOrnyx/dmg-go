#+TITLE: silly little project diary

* Intro
This is kinda gonna be like a little day by day record of what shit
I've done here and etc. probs gonna be pretty unhinged but idc

* <2023-11-30 Thu>
Today I started the project. Began to slowly understand how the system
works. not much done on the programming end except for slowly
implementing some of the cpu instruction functions.

Found a couple helpful resources to help me along and a couple
existing projects to help me. Things are looking.... hopeful

TLDR: So like basically so far I've started researching the
architecture and stuff and begun implementing the CPU starting with the instructions

* <2023-12-01 Fri> Day Two
Alright, new day, new me. Todays plan is getting the CPU instruction
functions properly implemented and stuff.

Today I started working on the cartridge and MMU stuff while also
continuing to implement the CPU. It's kinda sad how much of my code is
kinda plagiarzed but I'm definitely understanding some stuff. Like
that the stupid instructions read from memory. Idk why I didn't make
that connection before but hooray.

* <2023-12-06 Wed>Day Three
After a small hiatus due to my stupid job I was back at it again.

After a long day of work about more than halfish of the unprefixed CPU
instructions have been written and a lot more understanding has been
gained. project is looking up and hopefully most of the CPU (excluding
the prefixed instructions lmao) should be completed by the next day I
work on this.

Also finally started understanding some of the stupid stuff like (HL) vs HL etc

* <2023-12-08 Fri>Day Four
Today I finally pretty much finished the unprefixed CPU instructions,
it was kinda hard for some of it but honestly it kinda helped quite a
lot as it gave me a bit more understanding for some of the stuff I'm
doing etc.

The code can definitely be optimized etc and I've got like 50 TODO's
to check but the groundwork is looking promising. Hopefully by this
time next week the CPU should be like fully finished and I should be
moving onto either the memory, PPU or smth else.

* <2023-12-13 Wed>Day Five
Today I started to work on some of the other parts of the emulator,
that being the MMU, the cartridge and the MBC's etc. It took quite a
while to kind of understand how everything works but I kindddd of get
it now

Now I just need to continue implementing the MBC's and connecting
everything together (as well as you know, actually do the prefixed
instructions for the CPU)

* <2023-12-14 Thu>Day Six
Today was.... a day. I spent about like 3 hours trying to google how
the hell to implement the timer before going to the emudev discord
where some much smarter people than me helped. So now it's kinda
implemented, needs a couple tweaks and testing but hey, it's there.

I also managed to start implementing the interrupts properly, it's
pretty basic at the moment and still needs a bit done but it's a start.

I also worked on some more of the prefixed instructions as that's like
one thing I should really finish. Shouldn't take that long however as
most of the sections are set up pretty similar so it's pretty easy to
copy and paste sections and just like change a word

* <2024-01-17 Wed>Day Seven
It's been..... a very long time since I did work on this, about like a
month. But uni was closed over christmas and new year so couldn't go in and I've
had work etc etc blah blah blah whatever.

Anyway today I finished the CPU instructions and am currently in the process of
"debugging" by which I mean "wondering why nothing is working and working
backwards to fix it" but all seems to be going fine, I'm also just gonna make a
debugger to test my stuff

* <2024-01-24 Wed>Day Eight Part one
Okay so I forgot to record the last session so sorry for that, wasn't too
productive
Basically the last time I was working on this I was just getting a basic
debugger going and I kinda realized I just absolute fucked everything...

So now I'm scaling back the project, it's just gonna be a regular gameboy
emulator for now, not color. I will attempt color in the future but at the
moment there's too many barely documented things that are tripping me up.

* <2024-01-24 Wed>Day Eight Part two
After a long day of trying to figure out shit and rewriting the MMU I figured
out the problem I was having was to do with none of them, it was my own
stupiditiy ðŸ˜Ž

Basically the ROM's have a jump function so they can you know, jump to the
functions they need to run and it uses the next two immediate bytes slapped
together as its jump point. My problem... I switched my stupid system to
immediately increment the program counter after I loaded the opcode, but my
operands were still using pc+1 and pc+2 to load the values, so I was jumping to
a way larger value than I wanted, but anyway I fixed it.

So now onto testing and stuff ig

* <2024-01-25 Thu>Day Nine
Today was a pretty productive day ngl, finally figured out some of thr problems
(and parts where I was being dumb and making myself problems) with stuff and
started testing the CPU inststructions with the blargg test roms, as of writing
this I have all but 2 done. I am not at all looking forward to doing the one for
the interrupts, that's gonna suck.

But yeah, got a proper debug setup for stuff like gameboy doctor and am busy
testing the CPU instructions and fixing as many problems as I can

* <2024-01-31 Wed>Day Ten 
I finally did it!
The CPU instructions all passed!!! I am FRee!!!
But like yeah I got it all working, started with test 11 not working because I
fucked up my swap instruction (forgot to write the result lmao) and then the
instructions thankfully worked without a lot of tinkering, well...
Except for the timer, the timer was annoying and bullshit and I hate it. It was
a simple fix tho, basically I was passing in m-cycles and forgot to both

+ Have my code actually increase by the cycles rather than one
+ Have my code run through a for loop to increase the timer by 4 t-cycles
  individually for each m-cycle

but yeah once I figured that out it was all good and working!!

Anyway now onto the PPU (pain)...

-----

Alright so the PPU....
It's uh, definitely a thing. It's a really confusing mess I'm ngl so I've
started a file to take notes of specific parts of it that should help but it's
gonna take a while to get everything working. But I'm gonna take a smarter
approach this time, instead of just plunging straight into it I'm gonna take
some time to plan things out and make sure I've got everything working before I
start implementing a lot of important code.

I also moved a couple of things from the MMU into the PPU as I felt it'd be a
bit easier to access and utilize them there. The things I moved was the VRAM, as
I felt it suited the PPU a bit better, I also moved the OAM for the same reason
and the last thing I moved was the LCD section of the IO registers as once
again, much nicer to have in the PPU section

But yeah, things seem to be going smoothly ðŸ˜Ž

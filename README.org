#+TITLE: DMG-go

* DMG-go
Hi and welcome to the repo for my (hopefully completed) Gameboy DMG emulator
written in go. This is a first attempt at systems stuff so it's not the best and
quite inaccurate but I hope this can serve as a good learning resource or smth
for other people hoping to attempt the same thing.

NOTE - this was originally supposed to be a Gameboy Color emulator but I decided
partway through to just focus on doing basic DMG emulation as CGB seemed to
hard, however you may still find traces of GBC stuff in here

* Current features and TODO's
+ [X] Functional (albeit inaccurate) CPU
+ [X] Working PPU (but needs fixing)
+ [X] Basic saving and loading
+ [ ] Audio
+ [ ] CGB support (probably unlikely)
+ [-] MBC support [4/5]
  + [X] MBC0
  + [X] MBC1
  + [ ] MBC2
  + [X] MBC3 (timer not implemented)
  + [X] MBC5

* Resources and credits
I used a lot of resources and I also +plagiarized+ +borrowed+ referenced some
already existing gameboy/color emulators for inspiration and to get an idea of
how they did their stuff.

[[https://github.com/djhworld/gomeboycolor]] - this is another gameboy-color
emulator written in go that I used as a reference point for a couple of parts of
mine. It's a very well made project and I thank the creator üôè

[[https://gekkio.fi/files/gb-docs/gbctr.pdf]] - The gameboy technical
reference. This one helped a lot with the creation of the CPU instruction
functions as it helped me clearly see how some of the functions operated

[[https://gbdev.io/gb-opcodes//optables/]] - This is one of quite a few tables that
show all of the CPU instruction functions along with their OPCode and other
stuff, this helped quite a lot with understanding the CPU instructions more as
well

[[https://rylev.github.io/DMG-01/public/book/introduction.html]] - I didn't end up
following this one exactly but it was helpful as a baseline to help me
understand the basics of emulating the system and served as a great entry
point. Also really well written (even tho it uses rust ü§¢)

[[https://gbdev.io/pandocs]] - The absolute beast, like 90% of the information I
gained came from this, many places tell you to use this and I can see why. It's
amazingly written and while it can be a little bit confusing it's amazing
reference material


[[https://hacktix.github.io/GBEDG/]] - Great for helping with quite a few things as
it specified some things that are either vaguely described in the pandocs or
just aren't
